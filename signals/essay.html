  <h1>Ultra-rare Pokémon card from 1998 sold for £150,000 breaking world record</h1>

<p>A POKEMON card featuring Pikachu has just become the most expensive ever, selling for $195,000 (£152,000) at auction. That figure is staggering considering a single packet of Pokemon cards usually sells for less than £5 in the UK. The card is known as the Pikachu Illustrator card.The pricey item is referred to as the Pikachu Illustrator card because it features an image of Pikachu holding a pen.</p>

<p>
A limited number were released in 1998 to be given out as prizes in a illustration competition. The card's auction description read: "Pokémon "Pikachu Illustrator" Trainer Promo Hologram Trading Card, 1998. Graded PSA 9 Mint. Fan-favorite Pikachu, stars on the most valuable and rarest Pokémon card in the world! "Although the technical name for the card is "PokémonIllustrator", it is colloquially known as "Pikachu Illustrator" due to the image." The fact the card was originally a prize makes it even rarer.
Only 39 copies have ever been released.</p>

<p>
The auction description continued: "It is not known exactly how many surviving copies are still around; however, only 10 PSA certified copies are known, a very important note because there are many counterfeit copies.
"This card is considered the most rare of an individual Pokémon card.
"This is the only card in the long-running collectable card game series to say "Illustrator" at the top of a Trainer Card, and the only one to bear the pen symbol in the bottom right corner. The artwork is by Atsuko Nishida."
The card was sold at an auction in New York last week and is now officially the most expensive Pokémon in the world.

<p>
This meant it beat the record set by another Pikachu Illustrator card, which sold for around £78,000 on eBay in 2013. Unlike other Pokémon cards used for playing, it has no competitive effects. Instead it reads: "We certify that your illustration is an excellent entry in the Pokémon Card Game Illustration Contest. "Therefore, we state that you are an Officially Authorized Pokémon Card Illustrator and admire your skill."</p>
